# Implementation of deep neural network structures for the recognition of handwritten alphanumeric signs
The goal of the end of degree work is to implement different types of neural networks for the recognition and classification of images with alphanumeric signs (letters and numbers) in manuscripts. The field of deep learning and, in particular, deep neural networks will be analyzed. Once the knowledge on the subject is obtained, the most extended models to recognize and classify images of alphanumeric handwritten signs will be implemented. Then, variations of structures/parameters/neural network learning algorithms will be implemented to improve the performance and accuracy of the obtained systems.
